```

The primary use case for the `oxcovid19` package is for facilitating a simplified, R-based workflow for 1) connecting to the [OxCOVID19](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) server; 2) accessing table/s available from the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) server; and, 3) querying the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) server with specific parameters to customise table/s output for intended use. This workflow is illustrated in the workflow diagram below:

<br>

```{r workflowB, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/oxcovid19workflow.png")
```

<br>

The following code demonstrates how this workflow can be implemented in R:

```{r workflow1, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library(oxcovid19)

## Step 1: Create a connection to OxCOVID19 PostgreSQL server
con <- connect_oxcovid19()

## Step 2: Access epidemiology table from OxCOVID19 PostgreSQL server
epi_tab <- get_table(con = con, tbl_name = "epidemiology")

## Step 3: Query the epidemiology table to show data for Great Britain
gbr_epi_tab <- dplyr::filter(.data = epi_tab, countrycode == "GBR")
```

**Step 1** and **Step 2** above are facilitated by the `connect_oxcovid19` and the `get_table` functions provided by the `oxcovid19` package. These functions are basically low-level wrappers to functions in the [`DBI`](https://db.rstudio.com/dbi/) and [`RPostgres`](https://rpostgres.r-dbi.org) packages applied specifically to work with the [OxCOVID19](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). These functions facilitate convenient access to the server for general R users without having to learn to use the `DBI` and `RPostgres` packages.

**Step 3**, on the other hand, is facilitated by the `dplyr` package functions which were designed to work with different types of tables including those from various database server connections such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org).

The output of the workflow shown above is:

```{r workflow2, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
gbr_epi_tab
```

The `oxcovid19` package functions are also designed to allow *pipe operations* using the `magrittr` package. The workflow above can be done using piped operations as follows:

```{r workflow3, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
## Load magrittr to use pipe operator %>%
library(magrittr)

connect_oxcovid19() %>%
  get_table(tbl_name = "epidemiology") %>%
  dplyr::filter(countrycode == "GBR")
```

The workflow using the piped workflow outputs the same result as the earlier workflow but with a much streamlined use of code.
