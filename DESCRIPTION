Description: The OxCOVID19 Project <https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk> aims to increase
    our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and elaborate possible strategies
    to reduce the impact on the society through the combined power of statistical,
    mathematical modelling, and machine learning techniques. The OxCOVID19
    Database is a large, single-centre, multimodal relational database consisting
    of information (using acknowledged sources) related to COVID-19 pandemic.
    This package provides an R-specific interface to the OxCOVID19 Database based
    on widely-used data handling and manipulation approaches in R.
