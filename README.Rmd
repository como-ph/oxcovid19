The [OxCOVID19 Project](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) aims to increase our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and elaborate possible strategies to reduce the impact on the society through the combined power of statistical, mathematical modelling, and machine learning techniques. The [OxCOVID19 Database](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) is a large, single-centre, multimodal relational database consisting of information (using acknowledged sources) related to COVID-19 pandemic. This package provides an [R](https://www.r-project.org)-specific interface to the [OxCOVID19 Database](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) based on widely-used data handling and manipulation approaches in [R](https://www.r-project.org).

## Motivation

The [OxCOVID19 Project](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) team presented to the [CoMo Consortium](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/news/como-consortium-the-covid-19-pandemic-modelling-in-context) during its weekly meeting on the 1st of July 2020. During this meeting, the [CoMo Consortium](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/news/como-consortium-the-covid-19-pandemic-modelling-in-context) considered the use of the [OxCOVID19 Database](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk/) for use in filling data and information for country-specific parameters required in the [CoMo Consortium](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/news/como-consortium-the-covid-19-pandemic-modelling-in-context) model. Given that the [CoMo Consortium](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/news/como-consortium-the-covid-19-pandemic-modelling-in-context) model is [R](https://www.r-project.org)-centric, it makes logical sense to build an [R](https://www.r-project.org)-specific API to connect with the [OxCOVID19](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) database. This package aims to facilitate the possible use of the [OxCOVID19](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) database for this purpose through purposefully-written functions that connects an R user to the database directly from [R](https://www.r-project.org) (as opposed to doing a manual download of the data or using separate tools to access [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)) and processes and structures the available datasets into country-specific tables structured for the requirements of the [CoMo Consortium](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/news/como-consortium-the-covid-19-pandemic-modelling-in-context) model. A direct link to the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) via [R](https://www.r-project.org) is also advantageous as this is updated more frequently than the CSV datasets made available via [GitHub](https://github.com/covid19db/data).

## Installation

You can install `oxcovid19` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) with:
```{r install-cran, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("oxcovid19")
```

You can install the development version of `oxcovid19` from [GitHub](https://github.com/como-ph/oxcovid19) with:

```{r install-github, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
if(!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("como-ph/oxcovid19")
```

## Usage

The primary use case for the `oxcovid19` package is for facilitating a simplified, [R](https://www.r-project.org)-based workflow for 1) connecting to the [OxCOVID19](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) server; 2) accessing table/s available from the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) server; and, 3) querying the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) server with specific parameters to customise table/s output for intended use.

The following code demonstrates this workflow:

```{r workflow1, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library(oxcovid19)

## Step 1: Create a connection to OxCOVID19 PostgreSQL server
con <- connect_oxcovid19()

## Step 2: Access epidemiology table from OxCOVID19 PostgreSQL server
epi_tab <- get_table(con = con, tbl_name = "epidemiology")

## Step 3: Query the epidemiology table to show data for Great Britain
gbr_epi_tab <- dplyr::filter(.data = epi_tab, countrycode == "GBR")
```

**Step 1** and **Step 2** above are facilitated by the `connect_oxcovid19` and the `get_table` functions provided by the `oxcovid19` package. These functions are basically low-level wrappers to functions in the [`DBI`](https://db.rstudio.com/dbi/) and [`RPostgres`](https://rpostgres.r-dbi.org) packages applied specifically to work with the [OxCOVID19](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). These functions facilitate convenient access to the server for general [R](https://www.r-project.org) users without having to learn to use the `DBI` and `RPostgres` packages.

**Step 3**, on the other hand, is facilitated by the `dplyr` package functions which were designed to work with different types of tables including those from various database server connections such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org).

The output of the workflow shown above is:

```{r workflow2, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
gbr_epi_tab
```

Note that the output of this workflow looks like a `tibble` (which it partly is) but it is also more than that. Annotation shows some of the metadata about this table. Specifically it shows the *source* and the *database* from which this table is from. This output table has the following classes:

```{r workflow2a, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
class(gbr_epi_tab)
```

Other than being a `tibble`, the output is also a what is called a *"lazy"* table (`tbl_lazy`) or a *dbi* (database) table (`tbl_dib`). What this means is that the output table shown is not actually retrieved and the basic query (which in this case is selecting a specific table named `epidemiology`) is not actually run. This has its advantageous in that the data is not yet in memory in [R](https://www.r-project.org) which can save computing time particularly if only a subset of the table in the remote server is required, and further queries to the remote server can be declared to customise the data output. These further queries can be facilitated using `dplyr` verbs such as `filter`, `mutate`, `arrange` which also operates *lazily* when applied to `tbl_lazy` or `tbl_dbi` objects.

One can review the query parameter/s or the query plan applied to a `tbl_lazy` object by using the `get_metadata` function provided in `oxcovid19`:

```{r workflow2b, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
get_metadata(gbr_epi_tab)
```

The result is a list showing information on the remote table's `name`, `source`, `DBI connection`, `query text` and `query plan`.

It should also be noted that other [R](https://www.r-project.org) operations and functions will not work on `tbl_lazy` objects. For example, getting the number of rows of a `tbl_lazy` using `nrow` will result in `NA`:

```{r workflow2c, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
nrow(gbr_epi_tab)
```

These operations require for the table to be retrieved into [R](https://www.r-project.org) (discussed below).

The `oxcovid19` package functions are also designed to allow *pipe operations* using the `magrittr` package. The workflow above can be done using piped operations as follows:

```{r workflow3, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
## Load magrittr to use pipe operator %>%
library(magrittr)

connect_oxcovid19() %>%
  get_table(tbl_name = "epidemiology") %>%
  dplyr::filter(countrycode == "GBR")
```

The workflow using the piped workflow outputs the same result as the earlier workflow but with a much streamlined use of code.

Once all query parameters have been set to what is required, the actual data from the remote table can be retrieved into [R](https://www.r-project.org) by using the `collect` function:

```{r workflow4, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
dplyr::collect(gbr_epi_tab)
```

```{r workflow4a, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
class(dplyr::collect(gbr_epi_tab))
```

The resulting output is a `tbl` but is now retrieved into [R](https://www.r-project.org). Now, further [R](https://www.r-project.org) operations can be used:

```{r workflow4b, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
nrow(dplyr::collect(gbr_epi_tab))
```

It should be noted that the use of `collect` should be well-planned and ideally should be implemented once all required queries that can be issued lazily have been specified. Depending on the size of the remote database being accessed, using `collect` too early to retrieve data can cause significant computing overheads.

### Querying spatial layers

The [OxCOVID19 Database](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk/) includes a table named `administrative_division` which contains some spatial information. This table can be accessed via `oxcovid19` using the same approach described above:

```{r spatial1, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
connect_oxcovid19() %>% get_table(tbl_name = "administrative_division")
```

The `administrative_division` table contains rows of information on **longitude** and **latitude** for several countries and for administrative divisions (up to level 3) within some of these countries. In addition, each row of geographical area available in this table has area borders information in [simple features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features) format.

The **longitude** and **latitude** information can be easily accessed and utilised for mapping point locations using the `get_table` function. However, the area borders information in [simple features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features) format require specific parsing to be usable in [R](https://www.r-project.org). This is facilitated using the `sf` package. The `oxcovid19` package provides the `get_layer` function which is a wrapper function around the `st_read` function in the `sf` package to read [simple features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features) format data into [R](https://www.r-project.org).

To query the `administrative_division` table for the area borders data, the function `get_layer` is used as follows:

```{r spatial2, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
connect_oxcovid19() %>% get_layer(ccode = "GBR", adm = 0)
```

The `get_layer` function requires two main parameters. First, the country from which area borders are required need to be specified using its three-letter ISO code. In the example above, the ISO code `GBR` is used to specify the country United Kingdom. Second, the administrative division level should be indicated. This should be specified as a numeric value from 0 to 3 corresponding to country level borders (0), administrative level 1 borders such as regions or provinces (1), administrative level 2 borders such as districts or communes (2), and administrative level 3 borders such as sub-districts or sub-communes (3). In the example above, 0 is specified for country borders.

Once the area borders have been read into [R](https://www.r-project.org) using the `get_layer` function, further spatial data manipulation and processing can be done using other `sf` package functions. Further information on the `sf` package can be found [here](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/).

### Specialised functions

`oxcovid19` includes four specialised wrapper functions that facilitate easy access and query of specific tables available in the [OxCOVID19 Database](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk/) and reads the data into [R](https://www.r-project.org). These functions start with the `get_data_` prefix followed by the respective table descriptor.

**Function** | **Description**
:--- | :---
`get_data_epidemiology` | Get data from epidemiology table
`get_data_weather` | Get data from weather table
`get_data_mobility` | Get data from mobility table
`get_data_response` | Get data from government response table

Each of these `get_data_` functions can be supplied with specific query parameters to further refine the data to retrieve from the remote table.

**Query parameters** | **Description**
:--- | :---
`.source` | Query the table via the `source` field
`ccode` | Query the table via the `countrycode` field
`start`, `end` | Query the table via the `date` field
`adm` | Query the table via the `adm_area_1`, `adm_area_2` and `adm_area_3` fields

## Limitations

The `oxcovid19` package is in active development which will be dictated by the evolution of the [OxCOVID19 Database](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk/) over time. Whilst every attempt will be employed to maintain syntax of current functions, it is possible that current functions may change syntax or operability in order to ensure relevance or maybe deprecated in lieu of a more appropriate and/or more performant function. In either of these cases, any change will be well-documented and explained to users and deprecation will be staged in such a way that users will be informed in good time to allow for transition to using the new functions.

The [OxCOVID19 Database](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk/) is the result of many hours of volunteer efforts and generous contributions of many organisations. If you use a specific table please also cite the underlying source as described [here](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk/data_sources.html). Sources of specific tables can also be accessed via the `oxcovid19` package through the `data_sources` dataset. For example, if you have accessed the **Epidemiology** table from the database, you can access the sources for this table with:

```{r sources1, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data_sources[["epidemiology"]]
```

which gives the following result:

```{r sources2, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
data_sources[["epidemiology"]]
```

A utility function called `cite_sources` is also available. This function is applied to a dataset extracted from the [OxCOVID19 Database](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk/) using the `get_data` functions or a dataset that has been collected after using `get_table` function. For example:

```{r sources3, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## Get epidemiology data for UK
gbr_epi_tab <- get_data_epidemiology(ccode = "UK")

## Cite sources for UK epidemiology data
cite_sources(gbr_epi_tab)
```

This results in:

```{r sources4, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
## Get epidemiology data for UK
gbr_epi_tab <- get_data_epidemiology(ccode = "UK")

## Cite sources for UK epidemiology data
cite_sources(gbr_epi_tab)
```
