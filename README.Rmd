The [OxCOVID19 Project](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) aims to increase our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and elaborate possible strategies to reduce the impact on the society through the combined power of statistical, mathematical modelling, and machine learning techniques. The [OxCOVID19 Database](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) is a large, single-centre, multimodal relational database consisting of information (using acknowledged sources) related to COVID-19 pandemic. This package provides an [R](https://www.r-project.org)-specific interface to the [OxCOVID19 Database](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) based on widely-used data handling and manipulation approaches in [R](https://www.r-project.org).

## Motivation

The [OxCOVID19 Project](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) team presented to the [CoMo Consortium](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/news/como-consortium-the-covid-19-pandemic-modelling-in-context) during its weekly meeting on the 1st of July 2020. During this meeting, the [CoMo Consortium](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/news/como-consortium-the-covid-19-pandemic-modelling-in-context) considered the use of the [OxCOVID19 Database](http://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk/) for use in filling data and information for country-specific parameters required in the [CoMo Consortium](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/news/como-consortium-the-covid-19-pandemic-modelling-in-context) model. Given that the [CoMo Consortium](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/news/como-consortium-the-covid-19-pandemic-modelling-in-context) model is [R](https://www.r-project.org)-centric, it makes logical sense to build an [R](https://www.r-project.org)-specific API to connect with the [OxCOVID19](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) database. This package aims to facilitate the possible use of the [OxCOVID19](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) database for this purpose through purposefully-written functions that connects an R user to the database directly from [R](https://www.r-project.org) (as opposed to doing a manual download of the data or using separate tools to access [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)) and processes and structures the available datasets into country-specific tables structured for the requirements of the [CoMo Consortium](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/news/como-consortium-the-covid-19-pandemic-modelling-in-context) model. A direct link to the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) via [R](https://www.r-project.org) is also advantageous as this is updated more frequently than the CSV datasets made available via [GitHub](https://github.com/covid19db/data).

## Installation

You can install `oxcovid19` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) with:

```{r install-cran, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("oxcovid19")
```

You can install the development version of `oxcovid19` from [GitHub](https://github.com/como-ph/oxcovid19) with:

```{r install-github, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
if(!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("como-ph/oxcovid19")
```

## Usage

The primary use case for the `oxcovid19` package is for facilitating a simplified, [R](https://www.r-project.org)-based workflow for 1) connecting to the [OxCOVID19](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) server; 2) accessing table/s available from the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) server; and, 3) querying the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) server with specific parameters to customise table/s output for intended use.

The following code demonstrates this workflow:

```{r workflow1, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library(oxcovid19)

## Step 1: Create a connection to OxCOVID19 PostgreSQL server
con <- connect_oxcovid19()

## Step 2: Access epidemiology table from OxCOVID19 PostgreSQL server
epi_tab <- get_table(con = con, tbl_name = "epidemiology")

## Step 3: Query the epidemiology table to show data for Great Britain
gbr_epi_tab <- dplyr::filter(.data = epi_tab, countrycode == "GBR")
```

**Step 1** and **Step 2** above are facilitated by the `connect_oxcovid19` and the `get_table` functions provided by the `oxcovid19` package. These functions are basically low-level wrappers to functions in the [`DBI`](https://db.rstudio.com/dbi/) and [`RPostgres`](https://rpostgres.r-dbi.org) packages applied specifically to work with the [OxCOVID19](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk) [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). These functions facilitate convenient access to the server for general [R](https://www.r-project.org) users without having to learn to use the `DBI` and `RPostgres` packages.

**Step 3**, on the other hand, is facilitated by the `dplyr` package functions which were designed to work with different types of tables including those from various database server connections such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org).

The output of the workflow shown above is:

```{r workflow2, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
gbr_epi_tab
```

The `oxcovid19` package functions are also designed to allow *pipe operations* using the `magrittr` package. The workflow above can be done using piped operations as follows:

```{r workflow3, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
## Load magrittr to use pipe operator %>%
library(magrittr)

connect_oxcovid19() %>%
  get_table(tbl_name = "epidemiology") %>%
  dplyr::filter(countrycode == "GBR")
```

The workflow using the piped workflow outputs the same result as the earlier workflow but with a much streamlined use of code.

## Limitations

The `oxcovid19` package is in active development which will be dictated by the evolution of the [OxCOVID19 Database](http://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk/) over time. Whilst every attempt will be employed to maintain syntax of current functions, it is possible that current functions may change syntax or operability in order to ensure relevance or maybe deprecated in lieu of a more appropriate and/or more performant function. In either of these cases, any change will be well-documented and explained to users and deprecation will be staged in such a way that users will be informed in good time to allow for transition to using the new functions.

The [OxCOVID19 Database](http://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk/) is the result of many hours of volunteer efforts and generous contributions of many organisations. If you use a specific table please also cite the underlying source as described [here](https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk/data_sources.html). Sources of specific tables can also be accessed via the `oxcovid19` package through the `data_sources` dataset. For example, if you have accessed the **Epidemiology** table from the database, you can access the sources for this table with:

```{r sources1, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data_sources[["epidemiology"]]
```

which gives the following result:

```{r sources2, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
data_sources[["epidemiology"]]
```
